	The following level is generated from a file editable by you, the player! If working with the editor, find the projects asset folder and there will be a file named 'ProcFile.txt'. If not then create one. Regardless this file will be used to create an algorithmically generated level.

	The process used works on a mechanism called L-Systems (Lindenmyer Systems). This process allows for the creation of relatively complex fractal geometry, trees or in this case a tile based level based on the use of an input string, a context free grammar and a system analogous to turtle graphics. If the latter 2 sound unfamiliar to you (which they probably will) please feel free to look them up on Wikipedia and freshen up your knowledge of the topics.

	Now that you understand those principles, the following tables summarize both the turtle controls of the system as well as the grammar that will iterate over the seed string 9 times.

	Anyway, hope you enjoy and happy hunting!

	Turtle controls
		// [ store state
		// ] pop state
		// | go forward
		// > rotate 45 degrees clockwise
		// < rotate 45 counterclockwise

	Context Free Grammar
		// x place
		// "A" ==> [x[|B]>>[|B]>>[|B]>>[|B]]
		// "B" ==> [x[|D]>>[|C]]
		// "C" ==> x
		// "D" ==> [x[|E][<|F][>|F]]
		// "E" ==> x
		// "F" ==> [x[|G]
		// "G" ==> [x[<<|H][>>|H]
		// "H" ==> x
